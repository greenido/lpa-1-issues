Try to give the startups examples from your real world experience. In most cases, this is a better way to drive your points.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">It is great to say: &ldquo;let me think about it, and I&rsquo;ll get back to you later.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">We highly encourage you to invite another mentor to give his/her opinion.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">It is perfectly o.k. to disagree with a previous mentor, however, always try to provide the startup with the rationale behind these differences in approach so they can make up their own mind. Make sure you don&rsquo;t confuse them.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Good mentorship leads the startup in a proactive process:</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_pq4kct190ee-1 start" start="1"><li class="c2"><span class="c0">g</span><span class="c0">ive startups homework</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">instruct them what to do and use the outcome as a baseline for your next meeting with them (or their meetings with other mentors).</span></li></ol><ol class="c1 lst-kix_pq4kct190ee-0" start="20"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Remember that this is </span><span class="c0 c7">their</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;company. Mentorship is extremely valuable, and you will often be the expert, but ultimately they will need to choose what is best for their company.</span></li></ol><h1 class="c6" id="h.fk18qhmm46kb"><span class="c0">After your session</span></h1><ol class="c1 lst-kix_pq4kct190ee-0" start="21"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">The last 10 minutes of each session is designated for you to take notes and reflect on your session. Use the Accelerator app. Please be sure to do this--for the success of the startups and the program at-large.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Have a coffee :-)</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Everyday ends with a mentor debriefing session.
